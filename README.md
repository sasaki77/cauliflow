# CauliFlow

CauliFlow allows you to construct and run workflows by connecting multiple nodes in a YAML-format file.
CauliFlow enables the creation of flexible, reusable workflows by utilising three types of variable: Flowdata, Blackboard and Macros.
Although CauliFlow is primarily designed to work with EPICS PVs, it can also be used for other purposes.
